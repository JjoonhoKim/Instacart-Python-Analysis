# Instacart-Python-Analysis
## Objective

The objective is to conduct an initial data and exploratory analysis for Instacart, an online grocery store, to uncover more information about their sales patterns. Despite already having strong sales, the goal is to derive insights and propose strategies for improved segmentation based on provided criteria.

## Context

Instacart stakeholders prioritize understanding customer variety and purchasing behaviors. Recognizing the need for targeted marketing, they aim to tailor campaigns for different customer segments. This analysis will guide the development of a strategy to ensure Instacart effectively targets specific customer profiles with relevant products.

**Key Questions**

●The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the
day are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at
times when there are fewer orders.


● They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people
spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at
these times.

● Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to
use simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.

● Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing
and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of
product orders.

● The marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in the different types of
customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ.
